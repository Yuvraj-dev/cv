  <p>I am a Junior Software Developer working on automations projects at Oracle Communications. I have two years of experience in automation. In these two years at Oracle I have learnt many software technologies like Python, Behave Framework, telecom
    enterprise applications like DSR, UDR, PCRF, Source Code Mangement - Git, Cloudlab, various project management and tracking applications like Jira and Confluence. I thank my colleagues, managers, mentors, seniors for being there whenever I was
    stuck. They helped in identifying the problem and finding solutions. For any software blocker, we can have multiple solutions. Every Developer thinks uniquely and solves it accordingly. Here, thanks to all my Seniors, I was pushed to think out of
    the box and acknowledge others thoughts. I could see how they solve the issue which was much more efficient. I am thankful to God for providing me this oppurtunity to work at this world-class organization and working with some of the most
    talented, hard-working, helpful people I have ever met. Being born in one of the remotest part of the rural India, I could have never asked anything more. At this juncture, I would like tell you about my beginnings. I was born in Daspan, a tiny
    village in western Rajasthan. There were little to no facilities but I am proud to be born in such a culturally rich part of India. We celebrated many festivals. Diwali, Holi and Shivratri being the most prominent ones.</p>
